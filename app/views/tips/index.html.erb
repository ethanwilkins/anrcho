      All posts are proposals, each one can be voted for, showing your agreement or your support, or voted against, effectively blocking the proposal and moving it to a section for revision and review.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      However, for any vote to count, it must first be verified by a peer who have already been verified using the captcha, so as to prevent abuse by bots.
