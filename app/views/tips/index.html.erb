    Proposals and Voting
  </h4>

      All posts are proposals, each one can be voted for, showing your agreement or your support, or voted against, effectively blocking the proposal and moving it to a section for revision and review.

      However, for any vote to count, it must first be verified by a peer who has already been verified using the captcha, so as to prevent abuse by 'trolls' or bots.
