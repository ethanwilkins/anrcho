Anrcho - An Anonymous, Open Source Social Network
======
Anrcho is an anonymous social network designed to facilitate democratic organization and consensus
building within local communities. Each post is in the form of proposal, to do some action or plan
some local event, allowing anyone to support, block, or discuss any proposal made publicly. Via
this model of consensus, anyone can begin organizing locally, securely, and on a peer to peer
basis with the members of their community.
