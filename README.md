Anrcho - Organize, resist, and build consensus
======
Anrcho is an anonymous social network and voting platform built for the workers of the world, or an increasingy cyber-centric proletariat, designed to facilitate democratic organization and consensus building within local or international communities. Each post is in the form of a motion or proposal, to do some action or plan some local event, enabling anyone to support, block, or discuss any given proposal with complete and total anonymity. Via this model of consensus, anyone can begin organizing with the members of their community, locally or globally, the tools .

## How Anrcho works

Each post is in the form of a motion or proposal, so other users can either vote for or against said post/motion/proposal. Before a vote can be officially accounted for, it must first have an accompanying body of text explaing the reasoning or logic behind their vote, therefore enabling verification therefore peer review by other users that have already been verified as human (non-bot) by Captcha. Ratification of a proposal occurs only once a certain number of supporting votes have been verified.

If, on the other hand, a vote against a proposal is ever verified, that proposal will remain in a section for revision until a new version can be ratified and brought back to the initial voting phase where official ratification is once again possible.

However, if a proposal is blocked, that vote to block can also be reversed if a majority vote is reached against it, instead of requiring any further revision, keeping a check and balance between minority and majority. This same process can actually apply to votes of support as well, enabling anyone to reverse the blocking or ratification of any given proposal.
